Accessible from all points in the Bicol Region, the STI Academic Center – Naga aims to provide unparalleled education in Information and Communications Technology, Engineering, and Hospitality & Tourism Management.</p>
            <p><h2>The eager students of Bicol can now take advantage of STI Academic Center</h2> – Naga's fully air-conditioned classrooms, computer laboratories with flat screen monitors, hot and cold kitchen areas, mock front office, dining area, and suite room for its Hotel and Restaurant Management students, and a library packed with the latest research materials.
